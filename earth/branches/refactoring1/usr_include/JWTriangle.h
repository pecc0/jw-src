/**
 * We will tessellate the earth into triangles. We start the tessellation from an octahedron.
 * Then we start to recursively divide each of the triangles into 4 little triangles.
 * The "history" of each received triangle is stored into its TrIndex. The first 8 triangles
 * of the octahedron has TrIndex 0b000 - 0b111. Then at each iteration, we occupy 2 more bits
 * of the u32 type. The child triangles are numbered 0b00 - 0b11. The center triangle is
 * always 0b11, the other triangles are numbered according to the vertex they share with
 * the parent. I don't store the value TrIndex here because it is used as a key in the map, so we have it there.
 * The level of the triangle is the iteration at which we have received the
 * triangle. The triangles of the octahedron have level=0. We don't store this value because
 * it is too common and we could take it from outside. A triangle is considered
 * "upside" if 1 of its edges is above the 2 others. 4 of the octahedron triangles are "upside".
 * When we divide a triangle, only the central one changes its direction.
 * So we can easily determine whether a triangle is upside by having its TrIndex and its level.
 * In m_vNeighbours we store the indexes of the neighbour triangles.
 *
