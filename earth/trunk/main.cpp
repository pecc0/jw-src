/** Example 003 Custom SceneNode

 This Tutorial is more advanced than the previous ones.
 If you are currently just playing around with the Irrlicht
 engine, you may want to look at other examples first.
 This tutorials shows how to create a custom scene node and
 how to use it in the engine. A custom scene node is needed
 if you want to implement a render technique the Irrlicht
 Engine currently does not support. For example, you can write
 an indoor portal based renderer or an advanced terrain scene
 node with it. By creating custom scene nodes, you can
 easily extend the Irrlicht Engine and adapt it to your own
 needs.

 I will keep the tutorial simple: Keep everything very
 short, everything in one .cpp file, and I'll use the engine
 here as in all other tutorials.

 To start, I include the header files, use the irr namespace,
 and tell the linker to link with the .lib file.
