/**
 * We will tessellate the sphere into triangles. We start the tessellation from an octahedron.
 * Then we start to recursively divide each of the triangles into 4 little triangles.
 * We have a clever style of indexing the triangles - see JWTriangle. We must also store
 * the vertexes of the mesh, but they are only linked functionally to the triangles.
 * For each triangle, we store only its neighbor triangles, ordered 0-2. We number the edges
 * of the triangle again with 0-2, and according to the index of the neighbour with which the
 * edge is shared. We internally number the vertexes of the triangle with 0-2, so that
 * the internal index of the vertex is equal to the index of the edge counter clockwise
 * from the vertex. We globally index the vertextes in following way:
 * The vertex receives its index from the triangle for which this vertex is at number 0 in the
 * internal numbering. In most cases, there are 2 triangles for which the vertex is at number 0.
 * So then we choose the triangle which is "upside" (see JWTriangle::isUpside). We choose
 * the initial octahedron so that there isn't a vertex with 2 upside triangles for which the
 * vertex is 0. This is possible. At next iterations, it is always true that if there are 2
 * triangles for which the vertex is at 0, one of them is upside, the other is not.
